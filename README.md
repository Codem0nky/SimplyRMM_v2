# SimplyRMM
====================================================================================
The SimplyRMM application, intricately engineered utilizing a microservices-based SPA architecture, emerges 
as a state-of-the-art integration platform, tailored to refine and accelerate patch management processes, 
within Symantec ITMS. It not only extends the patch management and software deployment 
capabilities but also introduces enhanced dashboarding and automation features.

The user-centric design of SimplyRMM, boasting intuitive and interactive dashboards, effortlessly converts 
intricate data into visually compelling, actionable insights. Users find themselves empowered with the unprecedented 
clarity essential for making informed decisions and executing timely actions. It particularly excels in simplifying 
software update deployments; users can swiftly implement required updates, informed by the comprehensive yet 
straightforward information displayed.

In large federated organizations, the centralized console feature of SimplyRMM proves invaluable, markedly reducing 
complexity and maintenance costs. The single pane of glass view allows for the consolidation of vital data and 
functionalities, facilitating effortless management and oversight. Admins, whether overseeing base OS or specific 
applications, can customize and focus their views to monitor and action device updates efficiently.

The application supports a decentralized, federated approach wherein different teams, including base OS and 
application owners, are entrusted with the distribution of updates pertinent to their domains. This not only 
expedites the remediation processes but also ensures that updates are meticulously tested and approved, mitigating 
potential impacts on applications. The multifaceted ownership of device actions in this model ensures a 
swift, efficient, and highly responsive update deployment and management ecosystem.
